Simple: easy to learn, and its syntax is simple
Secured: Java Program always runs in Java runtime environment
Object Oriented: everything is an object which has some data and behavior
Robust: Java is strong. Exception handling & memory management.
Portable: carry the Java byte code to any platform

Platform Independent: Java is a write once, run anywhere language.
Architecture-neutral: Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format.
Interpreted: Source code byte code JVM(interpreter)

Variables = Containers which holds a value
Data – (stored)  varaiables –(means)not fixed

Syntax:
type variable_name = value;

Ex:
int a=20;
char f=’h’;

Operators:
