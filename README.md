# Java-Practice

<strong>History of Java:</strong>

Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and release in 1995. Initially, it was called Oak. Java is an Island and Java Coffee.

We can use 

•	Desktop Application

•	Web Applications

•	Enterprise Applications

•	Robotics, Games

<strong>Simple:</strong> easy to learn, and its syntax is simple

<strong>Secured: </strong>Java Program always runs in Java runtime environment

<strong>Object Oriented:</strong> everything is an object which has some data and behavior

<strong>Robust:</strong> Java is strong. Exception handling & memory management.

<strong>Portable:</strong> carry the Java byte code to any platform

<strong>Platform Independent:</strong> Java is a write once, run anywhere language.

<strong>Architecture-neutral: </strong>Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format.

Interpreted: </strong>Source code byte code JVM(interpreter)

<strong>Variables</strong> = Containers which holds a value
Data – (stored)  varaiables –(means)not fixed

<strong>Syntax:</strong>
type variable_name = value;

Ex:
int a=20;
char f=’h’;

<strong>Operators:</strong>


<strong>Arithmetic operators</strong> are used to performing arithmetic operations

Syntax: operand1 + operand2;  , operand1 - operand2;  

<strong>Assignment :</strong> The assignment operator is used to assign value to a variable. The value given on the right-hand side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left. 

Syntax:Variable_Name = value


<strong>Unary Operator:</strong>

•	Unary minus (-): It used to convert in a negative number.

•	Unary plus (+): It used to convert in a positive number.

•	Increment operator (++): it increments the value by 1

•	Decrement operator (--): it decrements the value by 1

Syntax: operand++, operand--, ~(operand), !(operand)


<strong>Relational:</strong> These operators are used to check the relations between two values. It returns the Boolean result.

Syntax: var1 == var2; var1 != var2; var1 > var2; var1 >= var2


<strong>Ternary: </strong>The ternary operator is an alternate version of the if-else statement. It is based on condition. It has three operands.

Syntax: Condition ? first statement : second statement;



<strong>Logical:</strong>

Logical And (&&): will return true if both conditions are true.

Logical Or (||): It will return true if at least one condition is true.

Logical NOT (!): It is used to reverse the state of the variable.

Syntax: Cond1 && Cond2; , Cond1 || Cond2;  , !(Cond);


Bitwise OR(|) : This operator is a binary operator, denoted by ‘|’ . either of the bits is 1, it gives 1, else it gives 0.


Bitwise  AND (&) : This operator is binary operator, denoted by ‘&’. Both bits are 1, it gives 1, else it gives 0.


Bitwise XOR(^) This operator is a binary operator, denoted by '^'. Corresponding bits are different, it gives 1 else it gives 0.

				 
Bitwise complement (~) This operator is unary operator, denoted by ~ . it returns the one's complement representation of the input value, i.e., it makes every 0 to 1,  and every 1 to 0


<strong>Control Flow Statement</strong>
Using control statements we can control the flow of Java code

3types of control flow statements

•	Conditional statements

•	Loop statements

•	Jump statements
